**RP-1 v1.12.3 Play through**
   
## TIPS
Double check if HP tank is needed. This can save mass if you have a HP tank but an engine that does not need it.

Don't forget to unpack the spare chutes to save on mass and cost (default is 5)

Reduce the fairing density to min to save mass unless it is needed for heat protection.

3:1 VAB and R&D points until about 20 then try to maintain about 1:1.25 ratio favouring faster R&D as it will be more of a limiter for contracts.

Take path to inter planetary comms and 1962 engines as most direct path after getting first rocket planes. Orbital Manned space flight can come latter but these will give you good science from the interplanetary missions.

A second VAB line is not worth it until you have around 200 points in the VAB upgrades. Better off spending the money in speeding up the production line before that point as the ROI on the increased VAB speed and second line is not worth it. (similar for science, only unlock as required to progress the tech tree). 

Venus/Mercury : Need Comms tech level 3 and solar 0 (as close to sun)
Mars : Needs comms tech level 5 and deployable solar 1 (size constraints, long transit and 70% reduction in sun)
Jupiter : Need Hydrolox and can just get away with Level 2 solar and Level 5 Comms with 2M Dish
Saturn : Need RTGs
